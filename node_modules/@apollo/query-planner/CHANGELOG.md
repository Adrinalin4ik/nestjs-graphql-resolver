## vNEXT

> The changes noted within this `vNEXT` section have not been released yet.  New PRs and commits which introduce changes should include an entry in this `vNEXT` section as part of their development.  When a release is being prepared, a new header will be (manually) created below and the appropriate changes within that release will be moved into the new section.

- Add missing `deep-equal` dependency, which was accidentally installed to the monorepo's root. [PR #709](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/709)

# v0.1.3

- Fix query plans missing fields in some situations involving nested type conditions (#396).
- Fix duplicate fetches in query plans [PR #671](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/671).

# v0.1.2

- This change is mostly a set of follow-up changes for PR #622. Most of these changes are internal (renaming, etc.). Some noteworthy changes worth mentioning are: the splitting of entity and value type metadata types and a conversion of GraphMap to an actual `Map` (which resulted in some additional assertions). [PR #656](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/656)

# v0.1.1

- Remove unnecessary dependency on `@apollo/query-planner-wasm`

# v0.1.0

- Initial release of TypeScript query planner code extracted from `@apollo/gateway`. (Previous releases of this package were wrappers around `@apollo/query-planner-wasm`, a different implementation.)
